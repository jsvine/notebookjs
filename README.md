# notebook.js `v0.3.2`

Notebook.js parses raw [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)/[IPython](http://ipython.org/) notebooks, and lets you render them as HTML. See a __[working demo here](https://jsvine.github.io/nbpreview/)__.

## Usage

Notebook.js works in the browser and in Node.js. Usage is fairly straightforward.

### Browser Usage

First, provide access to `nb` via a script tag:

```html
<script src="notebook.js"></script>
```

Then parse, render, and (perhaps) append:

```
var notebook = nb.parse(raw_ipynb_json_string);
var rendered = notebook.render();
document.body.appendChild(rendered);
```

You also can read a remote file with promise.

```
nb.readRemoteNotebookFile(url).then(function(file){
    var notebook = nb.parse(file);
    var rendered = notebook.render();
    document.body.appendChild(rendered);
})
```

### Node.js Usage

To install:

```sh
npm install notebookjs
```

Then parse, render, and write:

```js
var fs = require ("fs");
var nb = require("notebookjs");
var ipynb = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("path/to/notebook.ipynb"));
var notebook = nb.parse(ipynb);
console.log(notebook.render().outerHTML);
```

## Markdown and ANSI-coloring

By default, notebook.js supports [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for Markdown rendering, and [ansi_up](https://github.com/drudru/ansi_up) for ANSI-coloring. It does not, however, ship with those libraries, so you must `<script>`-include or `require` them before initializing notebook.js.

To support other Markdown or ANSI-coloring engines, set `nb.markdown` and/or `nb.ansi` to functions that accept raw text and return rendered text.

## Code-Highlighting

Notebook.js plays well with code-highlighting libraries. See [NBPreview](https://github.com/jsvine/nbpreview)
for an example of how to add support for your preferred highlighter. However, if you wish to inject your own
highlighting, you can install a custom highlighter function by adding it under the `highlighter` name in an
`notebookjs` instance. For instance, here is an implementation which colorizes languages using
[Prismjs](http://prismjs.com) during page generation for a static site:

```js
var Prism = require('prismjs');

var highlighter = function(code, lang) {
    if (typeof lang === 'undefined') lang = 'markup';

    if (!Prism.languages.hasOwnProperty(lang)) {
        try {
            require('prismjs/components/prism-' + lang + '.js');
        } catch (e) {
            console.warn('** failed to load Prism lang: ' + lang);
            Prism.languages[lang] = false;
        }
    }

    return Prism.languages[lang] ? Prism.highlight(code, Prism.languages[lang]) : code;
};

var nb = require("notebookjs");
nb.highlighter = function(text, pre, code, lang) {
        var language = lang || 'text';
        pre.className = 'language-' + language;
        if (typeof code != 'undefined') {
            code.className = 'language-' + language;
        }
        return highlighter(text, language);
    };
```

A `highlighter` function takes up to four arguments:

* `text` -- text of the cell to highlight
* `pre` -- the DOM `<pre>` node that holds the cell
* `code` -- the DOM `<code>` node that holds the cell (if `undefined` then text is not code)
* `lang` -- the language of the code in the cell (if `undefined` then text is not code)

The function should at least return the original `text` value if it cannot perform any highlighting.

## MathJax 

Notebook.js currently doesn't support MathJax. Implementation suggestions welcome. (Markdown-parsing was interfering with prior attempts.)

## Styling Rendered Notebooks

The HTML rendered by notebook.js (intentionally) does not contain any styling. But each key element has fairly straightfoward CSS classes that make styling your notebooks a cinch. See [`nbpreview`](https://github.com/jsvine/nbpreview)'s [stylesheet](https://github.com/jsvine/nbpreview/blob/master/css/nbpreview.css) for an example implementation.
